                <h2 class="title">Comparing yourself to others - is there a good side to it?</h2>
                <h3 class="subtitle">An introduction to comparison</h3>
                <p>Comparison is often viewed as something objectively negative, which seems too cynical in my view.  Comparison can inspire you to push yourself and learn from others. Though if excessive, it can poke holes in our self esteem. The important thing is recognising the way that we are comparing ourselves. Is it providing any benefits? If not, what are the alternatives?  </p>
                <h3 class="subtitle">Social comparison theory</h3>
                <p>In 1954, psychologist Leon Festinger put forward his social comparison theory, which suggests humans have an innate need to compare ourselves to others as a way to assess  our intelligence.  This is something we see everyday. As students, we often frantically  throw around questions like ‘what did you get for question 4?’ or ‘ what on earth was that last question?’  after a test. This response, though very natural, shifts us away from the most important thing: ourselves. This may sound incredibly self-centred, but there is value in realising that what your best friend got in the physics test is something they should reflect on, not you.  Though this is not always easy. So how do we overcome this unhelpful form of comparison? One way is to recognise the way that we are comparing ourselves. If it is in a self-deprecating manner, that is unhelpful to us.  Comparison only has value if it is out of curiosity, and a desire to improve. </p>
                <h3 class="subtitle">Recognising subjectivity</h3>
                <p>Grades are a complicated matter.  We all have our own perceptions of our ability, which is something important to remember when we compare ourselves. One person's idea of failure can be very different to someone else’s and so peer comparison attached to grades alone is worthless. You can’t learn a thing from the fact  that someone got a higher grade than you, that is just a statement.  The most beneficial thing you could do is assess your personal progress, asking yourself valuable questions like: Did I improve from last time? and if not, how can I? Do I need more support with this topic? </p>

                <h3 class="subtitle">Learning from others</h3>
                <p>I’ve found, from being in a friendship group filled with outstandingly intelligent people, that I sometimes dwell on what others have achieved  rather than focusing on my own next steps. So,  it would be hypocritical of me to plainly tell you not to do the same. Instead, I will tell you that there is a tremendous positive to being surrounded by smart people that I didn’t always notice: you can learn from them. Learning from people is the exact reason we go to school and it doesn't matter if this is from a teacher or a friend.  You might find that working with someone else occasionally can help you all out, because one person might be  great at one topic and you might be  great at another. Sharing the load can make revision seem like less of a daunting task.  I will be forever grateful for the periodic 3 hour long revision calls I had with one of my friends during GCSE study leave, talking about the longbow, the brown bess musket and smokeless powder.  The vast amount of content there is for History, suddenly seemed a lot more manageable.</p>
                <h3 class="subtitle">Overall Judgement</h3>
                <p>Comparison can be helpful when you use it as a tool to grow your skill set, rather than for criticising yourself.  You can learn so many things from other people. If one of your friends  is great at remembering dates for history, ask them how they revise. If one of your friends is great at watercolour, ask them to show you their process.  You might find you  benefit from a new approach, but if you find that their way of doing things doesn’t work for you, at least you have exercised the opportunity. Everyone learns differently. The main thing is  exploring new ways and finding what works for you, and sometimes comparison may very well lead you to that realisation. </p>
