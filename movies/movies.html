            <h2 class="subtitle">The Matrix (1999)</h2>
            <p>The Matrix is a mind-bending science fiction about a computer programmer, Neo, who has always questioned the reality of the world around him. His questions are seemingly answered when a mysterious man by the name of Morpheus, a rebel leader, comes into contact with him in order to reveal the truth. This film was a revolutionary film for the time, not just in terms of the subject matter but also in terms of the production. At the time, martial arts movies were not very mainstream in Hollywood and the usage of CGI is now known for being ahead of its time. This movie is really worth the watch and is perfect for anyone who loves science fiction and action.<br><strong>8.7/10 on IMDb</strong></p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">The Dark Knight (2010)</h2>
            <p>Known as being the best movie to have come out within the 2000s, Dark Knight is a movie adaptation of the DC comic superhero Batman. Directed by the Academy Award winner Christopher Nolan (also known for Oppenheimer and Inception) shows his intricate storytelling and attention to detail in the second film of the Dark Knight Trilogy. I believe that you can’t talk about this movie without mentioning the amazing performance from Heath Ledger, who so obviously showed his own commitment to his role of The Joker, this movie would cease to be as incredible as it is without the dedication from all the actors who star in it. Though, being an insanely popular film, it really is worth the watch.<br><strong>9/10 on IMDb</strong></p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Die Hard (1988)</h2>
            <p>A classic action film I believe anyone can enjoy, in short Die Hard is a thrilling movie about a NYPD officer visiting LA on his Christmas Holiday only to realise he’s got himself stuck in a hostage situation taking place at his wife’s office during a Christmas party. In my opinion Die Hard is an amazing film with many very memorable moments, as is expected when your villain is played by Alan Rickman. Truly a movie that can be enjoyed at any time and with anyone.<br><strong>8.2/10 on IMDb</strong></p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Wonka (2023) </h2>
            <p>Directed by Paul King who’s known for directing the Paddington movies, came out with Wonka in December of last year, a silly little movie which takes the audience along for a ride as we follow Willy Wonka’s journey to become the chocolate extraordinaire that we all know him as. The songs were catchy and in my opinion watching this film was a fun way to pass time with friends, though I wouldn’t personally watch it willingly by myself.<br><strong> 7.2/10 on IMDb</strong></p>
