        <h2 class="title">Finding a jumper that lasts</h2>
        <p>Clothes are an investment, especially those with a higher price. Ideally, the best clothes have a reasonable and affordable price, last long and are timeless so can be worn for many years.</p>
        <h3>Synthetic vs natural composition</h3>
        <p>In most high-street stores, a majority of clothes, including jumpers, will be made of synthetic fabrics such as polyester and acrylic. They’re used for their low production cost and versatility, which makes clothes cheaper and more accessible. These materials are made from derivatives of crude oil from which petrol is extracted.</p>
        <p>The main issues for the buyer are the poor breathability, odour retention and ,as an extension, lowered lifetime. This is because you may sweat more, meaning you wash it more often, which will wash out the colour and create pilling. Lifetime can be extended by wearing clothing underneath sweaters to keep them hygienic for longer.</p>
        <p>Poly-blends may seem like a better choice as the inclusion of different types of fibre can make up for the downfalls of each one . For example, cotton is excellent at moisture absorption but dries very slowly while synthetic fabrics absorb very little moisture so can feel awkward if you sweat. By mixing these, moisture can be managed effectively which is great for activewear or for warmer weather. Additionally, these often benefit from the low price points of synthetics.</p>
        <p>But, again, these are harmful for the environment, even being called “monstrous hybrids’ This is because once blended the fibres are near impossible to separate, making recycling of polyesters very difficult. Natural fibre blends avoid this and are completely biodegradable.</p>
        <p>A general rule of thumb is that, if possible,  it is best to avoid sweaters with more than 20% synthetic fabric.</p>    
        <h3>A short guide natural fabrics</h3>
        <p>So, you want to look for a jumper made of natural fabrics, but where to start and what to look for?</p>
        <h4>1. WOOL</h4>
        <p>Sheep’s wool has been used to make jumpers for a large part of human history (since at least 6000 BCE). There are many types of wool with slightly varying properties and textures, depending on the animal species it is taken from, and the techniques involved in producing it.</p>
        <p>Wool drapes well, can stretch and maintain its shape if cared for properly.  It provides great insulation because of its ability to trap air, making it ideal for winter wear. It also absorbs moisture but repels oil, meaning it won’t hold onto bad smells</p>
        <p>Stiffer wool strands with larger diameters will feel more itchy because they are less flexible so won’t change shape to suit the body and instead scratch at the skin. This is mostly an issue when buying online, since you can just touch a jumper to check if it's itchy. If you consistently find all wool products itchy, it may be caused by an allergy.</p>
        <p>To preserve its shape, wool should be washed by hand then laid flat to dry. If using a washing machine, the spin cycle should be gentle and use cold water. A milder detergent should also be used because normal detergents are made to break down proteins ( wool is a protein fibre).</p>
        <h4>2. MOHAIR</h4>
        <p>Mohair comes from angora goats, mixing the coarser topcoat and the softer undercoat which creates its distinct but controversial fuzzy look. This gives it a soft and dreamy feeling, as well as preventing an itchy texture. </p>

                <a href="https://lirikamatoshi.com/products/daisy-mohair-sweater-lm-x-dauphinette?_pos=6&_sid=570828177&_ss=r">https://lirikamatoshi.com/products/daisy-mohair-sweater-lm-x-dauphinette?_pos=6&_sid=570828177&_ss=r</a>
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p> It has a higher cost than other wools because of lowered production scale and a very annoying tendency to shed, leaving tiny threads everywhere which stick to everything. If you love the look and feel of mohair, a lint roller can easily deal with this.</p>
        <h4>3. CASHMERE</h4>
        <p> Cashmere comes exclusively from the undercoat of the cashmere goat, which is native to the mountains of Kashmir where temperatures can go as low as -40 C. This leads to very warm and soft material, being 3 times warmer than wool. However, this softness means cashmere is fragile and care must be taken to prevent damage.</p>
        <p>The cashmere Aran knit sweaters shown below are made for cold weather, based on the sweaters worn by fishermen on the Irish Aran islands. They have thick, carefully woven fibres and great draping . Not all cashmere is made equally though; quality of cashmere ranges greatly.</p>

        <p>Quality is determined by the fibre thickness, average length and percentage of short fibres. A  jumper with a high percentage of short fibres can pill more easily as short fibres are pulled out of alignment more easily. These can be identified by looking at the jumper - if it looks excessively fluffy, it has many short fibres. Another test is stretching a piece of the jumper to see if it returns to its original shape - if it stays in the shape it was stretched to, it is of lower quality.</p>
        <p>Price can also be an indicator of quality, as more expensive cashmere should be better quality. In general, cashmere is an expensive choice because of the low yields of cashmere goats ( about 200-300g per year) and the extensive processes that take the wool from the coat of a goat to a jumper. </p>
        <p>It may be more reasonable to buy cashmere jumpers second-hand, as prices can be significantly lower. However, make sure to wash them as soon as possible since clothes moths are very fond of cashmere, and can go on to cause great damage to clothes and even carpets.</p>
        <h4>4. COTTON</h4>
        <p>Cotton avoids the ethical issues of using animal products for human benefit and has different properties from wools, which means they’re best used for different occasions.</p>
        <p>It is not as warm as wools but far more breathable, making it better for warmer days. Caring for cotton is also much easier because it can be machine washed with other clothing and it pills less easily than wool.</p>
        <p>A sweater should be chosen considering how long it will last, the season it will be worn in, personal preferences and price point.  For more information, see sources below.</p>
