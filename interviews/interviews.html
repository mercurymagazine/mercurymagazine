        <strong>When you were younger, what were your favourite hobbies?</strong>
        <p>I’m a quiet person and generally I’d liked doing things on my own and so I think puzzles were a really big part of me growing up. I just loved the fact that I am able to dictate the rhythm and pace, how quickly I do a puzzle and actually the satisfaction of finishing one is immense.</p>
        <p>So one of my favourite puzzles, you won’t believe this, is actually one of Winnie the pooh; I have it framed and still have it in one of the rooms in my house and I look at it and think ‘ Gosh, when I was five I managed to do that puzzle and I’m so proud of it.’</p>
        <strong>Do you think your hobbies have changed over time?</strong>
        <p>Absolutely, I’m still a very quiet person, although now there are two things that I absolutely love. The first is to read; I love reading ,and biographies are really my thing. I love hearing people’s journeys and their stories because, more often than not. I take inspiration from them. </p>
        <p>And my second is seeing nature- going out for walks. Most weekends I try to go on a run for about 5k. But that said, it is getting harder when you get older to do that. </p>
        <strong>So, we take it that you’re someone who loves books, who loves reading and loves expanding your horizons. What would you say is your favourite book?</strong>
        <p>Well, interesting, I’ll  look back a little bit. When I was younger, right up until GCSEs, reading wasn’t really my thing. I couldn’t find what I enjoy and I would give up on a book quite quickly and easily, partly because I didn’t know what genre or theme I would be curious about. And then I came across Alexander McCall Smith’s the No1 Ladies’ Detective. He wrote a whole series of books based on a detective from Botswana and the stories were just so beautifully crafted, it really made me relate to her work and it eventually became a BBC series. </p>
        <p>I have to say the book is definitely much better than the series. That said , Alexander McCall Smith is probably my favourite author- Oh and Tim Marshall, I forgot about the geography.</p>
        <strong>Currently, we all have this app called Airbuds which shows what other people are listening to. Obviously we can’t see what you’re listening to, so what are your favourite genres/artists?</strong>
        <p>Probably Bob Marley. He makes me happy; I love visiting the Caribbean, and everywhere you go in the Caribbean you hear his voice, you hear his music and he just makes you feel good. it's just positive vibes. All of his songs, I absolutely love them.</p>
        <strong>What life tips can you give to students of the school?</strong>
        <p>I have a motto, and many of you have heard it before - ‘Be 10% braver.’ 
          But the other aspect of it is to be kind and work hard. Those are things I always remind myself of when I wake up, because by holding onto those principles every day is fulfilling, every day is purposeful. One thing I also always say is always look after people who have supported you and have pushed you forward. I don’t think I would've got to my career today without the network, without the connections that I’ve built over the years. I’ve really valued and appreciated advice - constructive most of the time, but the career progression that I’ve seen in myself is really down to the people who have supported me and believed in me. And so, take care of the people that look after you on the way up because you just never know where you can end up in life. 
        </p>
        <strong>As you’ve said, you never know where you can end up in life. If you didn’t end up as a teacher, what career would you pursue?</strong>
        <p>Wow, gosh, how sensational to be asked that question. I think I probably would’ve ended up working for Elon Musk. Those who have attended the lectures know that I find him as an individual absolutely fascinating; his innovation, his research, his ideas and ability to push forward with the future. I probably would work for him actually but not in my lifetime; that said you never know.</p>
        <strong>Pretend that you’re in an alternate universe and you could do anything that you wanted to do, where would life be taking you and where would you be living if not the UK?</strong>
        <p>That is a very big question and I feel I need to come on big ideas and I can’t think of any right now. So I would just say I would want the world to be one that is genuinely green - sustainable. One that embeds values that mean we are meeting the needs of the current without compromising future generations to meet their own needs. That’s what sustainability is all about and, to me, that is important, and I'm not sure right now on planet earth ,where we are, we are doing everything we can to ensure that happens. </p>
        <p>So if I had a choice, if I could live somewhere else, would I do that and become an outer planet species? I think I have to come back to you, I’m not sure. </p>
        <strong>At our school we have a variety of subjects, like loads of languages, but are there any subjects that we don’t teach at school that you think would be interesting to have here?</strong>
        <p>Absolutely, and it’s politics. I have long thought about how important it is to consider politics as an A level subject and how it’s important for young people to engage with different political systems and understand their rights. But actually politics itself is so much more also about developing new skills, the idea to challenge assumptions, to debate ideas and to actually form your own  opinion on something. Although I’m not making any promises, may I say. I’m not sure A level politics would be introduced for those of you who are watching this video and thinking we’ll have a new A level. </p>
        <strong>Finally, if you could choose someone to be your role model, dead or alive, who would it be?</strong>
        <p>I will have to say my role model is probably my mum. Without sharing too many details with you, she has so many qualities that I admire. She originally trained as a community nurse and then she found the courage to start her own business. And she turned a very small enterprise into something very global. Her work ethic has embedded in me, in the person I am today. Working hard does pay dividends and I see the hours she spent on getting to know people and finding the best ways to allow her business to evolve; and she just will not retire, that's the problem. And so I’m desperately wanting her to do some kind of semi-retirement. But that equally speaks volumes about her, purely because her work is so integral to who she is today and letting that go is really hard. But I look up to her always; I can’t imagine having somebody better than her as my mum.</p>
